I have taken Introduction to Embedded Systems as well as a little experience with Arduino. I am
currently in Computer Architecture as well as Introduction to VLSI. I have experience in Python, Java, and C
from previous CS classes.
Initially I wanted to be a CS major, but after taking some CS classes I decided I would enjoy Computer
Engineering more, as it allows for me to endulge in code while also learning about the hardware portion of
computers. After doing so I have much more enjoyed the hardware than the software, until I took intro to embedded.
It had really peaked my interest as it combined the circuitry with the coding that I loved to do. My hope for this class 
is to further my knowledge of computer science and hardware and how they connect, as well as using higher level computer
science principles with the embedded hardware.
